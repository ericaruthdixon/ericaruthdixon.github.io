      Hi! Welcome to my website. Thanks for being here!<br>
	  I am an artist based in so-called San Francisco, unceded land of the Ramaytush Ohlone. <br>
	  I make paintings, plant potions, and poems for people.<br>
	  Currently I mostly post about my offerings on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ericaruthdixon/">instagram </a> and share occasional thoughts on my blog <a href="https://slowfuture.substack.com/"> slow future. </a>
